<B>The while Loop</B>

The most basic loop in JavaScript is the while loop which would be discussed in this chapter. The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. Once the expression becomes false, the loop terminates.

SYNTAX:-
    while (expression) {
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}

<B>The do...while Loop</B>

The do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the condition check happens at the end of the loop. This means that the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.
