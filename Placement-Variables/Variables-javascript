like all programming lanaguage the javascript also accept the varibles and the variables are nothing named containers where you can place your data and used in later by mention ur variale name.
The procedure to write the varible name is by using javascript is keyword Var followed by "variable name"
    <script>
      var <variable name>;
      var <variable name>;
      var <variable name>;
   </script>
 As we said previously the javascript is case senstive, so keep that in mind while declearing and using your javascript variables.
In javascript variables declearation two types are there the global variables and local variables

Local variables:-  
            While you using javascript variables the variables which are decleared under the function are called local variables they have local scope it means can used within that function

Global Variables:-
            In javascript the variables which are decleared outside the function are called global variables these variables will have global scope they will accessed by any function without passing into function parameters
 
 for these both I have code files gothrough it for better understanding
