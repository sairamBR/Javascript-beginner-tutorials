The javascript has three different placement options in html pages sections
they are:- 
         <head> section
         <body> section
         (both <head> and <body> section)
         by Linking javascript files
         
   Example:- HTML PAGE CODE
                  <html>
                     <head>
                        <script src = "javascript.js" ></script> -----> JAVASCRIPT BY FILE LINKING
                        <script>
                            alert("head")-------------> JAVASCRIPT IN HEAD SECTION  |
                        </script>                                                   |
                     </head>                                                        |
                                                                                    |----> JAVASCRIPT IN BOTH HEAD AND BODY SECTION
                     <body>                                                         |
                         <br>                                                       |
                        <script>                                                    |
                          document.write("body")-------> JAVASCRIPT IN BODY SECTION |
                        </script>
                     </body>
                  </html>
In both Head and Body section method we use javascript statements directly in html file but while using file linking method we write all our javascriptstatements
in seprate file with .js extension and we link that file using src arttribute

   javascript file
                  document.write("javascript tutorials by sairam")
                  alert("javascript tutorials by sairam")
