Javascript Syntax
    The javascript is implenmented using the javascript statements that are placed within <script>......</script> within the head or body section of HTML file.
    For Example
          <html>
            <head>
              <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
                 alert("javascript tutorials by sairam")
              </script>
            </head>
            <body>
              <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
                document.write("Javascript tutorials by sairam")
              </script>
            </body>
          </html>
         
The script tag takes the two important attributes
        Language:- the language tag specifies the language we using in script tag
